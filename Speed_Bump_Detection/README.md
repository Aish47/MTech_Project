# Speed Bump Detection

This work introduces YOLO v5-based speed bump detection with respect to Indian scenario. From various public datasets, it was observed that speed bumps vary in size and nature from one location to another. So wanted to test how accurate the YOLO v5 model will work for detecting speed bumps in Indian scenario. First, the image dataset is prepared by merging different public domain datasets representing Indian scenarios. Then YOLO v5 model is trained on this dataset using transfer learning approach.
