# Stereo Vision Applications for Autonomous Vehicles

1. Callibration:  
Performed camera calibration so as to remove distortions from the image.

2. Mono Camera based Depth estimation:  
Depth estimation using single camera of the detected objects (Pedestrian). Tested the algorithm along with vehicle actuation. 

3. Stereo Camera based Depth estimation:  
Depth estimation using ZED 2i stereo camera. Tested the algorithm along with vehicle actuation and also performed brake test when pedestrian detected.

## Requirements

Software: ROS, pytorch, ZED SDK, CUDA  
Hardware: Jetson Orin (compute platform), ZED 2i camera.


*** Codes for some of the projects above have not been uploaded as the research is still ongoing.
